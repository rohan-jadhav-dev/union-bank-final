// conversation-desk.js — VoiceAssist AI
// Manual-step edition: no auto-advance. Staff ticks checklist items and
// clicks "Next" themselves. Top auto-strip removed; step indicator + checklist
// + Back/Next now live entirely in the staff panel.
//
// PATCH (this version): added cleanModelText() to strip stray JSON / markdown
// fences / "Here is the response:" preambles that the backend LLM sometimes
// returns instead of a clean string. Applied at every place a translation or
// transcript string from the backend gets shown or stored.
//
// PATCH 2 (this version): added LEAD AUTO-FILL — after a session ends,
// alongside the bilingual summary, conversation data is sent to a new
// backend endpoint that extracts structured form fields (name, loan type,
// income, etc.) using the LLM. Staff reviews/corrects the auto-filled form,
// then clicks "Send to Bank" to submit it as a lead via /submit-lead.
//
// PATCH 3 (this version): "Save to Records" no longer just toasts and
// returns to the dashboard. It now stores the conversation in sessionStorage
// (the same keys lead-form.html reads) and redirects straight to
// lead-form.html, where the lead is auto-extracted/auto-filled and staff
// only needs to review and click "Send to Bank".
